## Backend Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Interaction Management System backend, detailing the testing approach, environment setup, test types, and test execution procedures.

### Testing Approach

The backend testing strategy follows a layered approach, incorporating unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure comprehensive coverage and quality.

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual components (functions, classes, modules) in isolation to verify correct behavior and logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between different components and services, ensuring proper data flow and communication.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete user workflows and system behavior across multiple layers, simulating real-world scenarios.

### Test Environment Setup

The backend test environment is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose to ensure consistency and reproducibility across development, CI, and staging environments.

#### Components

- **Application**: Flask API backend service
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database service
- **Cache**: Redis cache service
- **Test Runner**: pytest with coverage and reporting plugins

#### Configuration

- The test environment is defined in `docker-compose.test.yml`.
- Environment variables are used to configure the application for testing, including database URLs, API keys, and logging levels.
- A separate test database is used to prevent data contamination.
- Mocked external services are used to isolate the backend during testing.

#### Fixtures

- pytest fixtures are used to manage test dependencies and setup/teardown tasks.
- Common fixtures include:
    - `app`: Flask application instance
    - `client`: Flask test client
    - `db_engine`: SQLAlchemy engine for test database
    - `db_setup`: Database setup and transaction management
    - `test_user`: Standard test user with authentication
    - `test_site`: Standard test site for site-scoped tests
    - `mock_user_context_service`: Mocked UserContextService
    - `mock_site_context_service`: Mocked SiteContextService
    - `mock_permission_service`: Mocked PermissionService

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests

- **Scope**: Individual components (functions, classes, modules)
- **Purpose**: Verify correct behavior and logic in isolation
- **Location**: `src/backend/tests/unit`
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Libraries**: unittest.mock, factory_boy
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<module>_<function>_<scenario>`
- **Example**: `test_auth_service_login_success`
- **Code Coverage**: > 90% line coverage

#### Integration Tests

- **Scope**: Interaction between components and services
- **Purpose**: Verify data flow and communication between components
- **Location**: `src/backend/tests/integration`
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Libraries**: pytest-flask, factory_boy
- **Naming Convention**: `test_<component1>_<component2>_<scenario>`
- **Example**: `test_api_auth_login_success`
- **Test Database**: PostgreSQL test database
- **External Services**: Mocked using unittest.mock

#### End-to-End Tests

- **Scope**: Complete user workflows and system behavior
- **Purpose**: Validate system functionality across multiple layers
- **Location**: `src/web/cypress/integration`
- **Framework**: Cypress
- **Test Environment**: Docker Compose with backend and frontend services
- **Test Data**: Seeded test database
- **Naming Convention**: `<feature>_<scenario>.spec.js`
- **Example**: `login_successful.spec.js`

### Test Execution

#### Local Development

- Developers run tests locally using pytest and Docker Compose.
- Unit tests are executed with `pytest tests/unit`.
- Integration tests are executed with `pytest tests/integration`.
- End-to-end tests are executed with `cypress run` in the `src/web` directory.

#### Continuous Integration

- Tests are automatically executed in the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`.
- The CI pipeline includes:
    - Code linting with Pylint and Flake8
    - Unit tests with pytest and coverage reporting
    - Integration tests with pytest and Docker Compose
    - Security scanning with Bandit and OWASP Dependency Check
- Test results and coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts.

#### Test Automation

The CI/CD pipeline automates the following testing stages:

1.  **Code Commit**: Developers commit code changes to the repository.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger**: A GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by the code commit.
3.  **Static Analysis**: The code is analyzed for style and potential issues.
4.  **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are executed to validate individual components.
5.  **Quality Gate**: The code must pass a defined quality gate to proceed.
6.  **Integration Tests**: Integration tests are executed to validate component interactions.
7.  **E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests are executed to validate full system functionality.
8.  **Build Artifacts**: Docker images and other artifacts are built.
9.  **Deploy to Environment**: Artifacts are deployed to the appropriate environment.
10. **Smoke Tests**: Smoke tests are executed to validate basic functionality in the deployed environment.
11. **Release Ready**: If all tests pass, the release is marked as ready.

### Quality Metrics

#### Code Coverage

- Unit tests must achieve a minimum code coverage of 90%.
- Integration tests must achieve a minimum code coverage of 80%.
- Code coverage reports are generated by pytest-cov and uploaded to Codecov.

#### Test Success Rate

- All tests must pass in the CI pipeline.
- Failed tests must be fixed before merging code changes.
- Flaky tests must be identified and addressed.

#### Performance Metrics

- API response times must be less than 500ms.
- Database query times must be less than 200ms.
- Performance tests are executed regularly to identify performance regressions.
